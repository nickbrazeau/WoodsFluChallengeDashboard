Large-scale analysis of 151 volunteers across seven challenge studies (H1N1, H3N2, RSV, HRV). Applied reference-aided machine learning comparing post-exposure to personal baseline. Using paired-reference approach boosted prediction accuracy by 14% for H3N2 and 6% for H1N1, while using fewer genes. Each person serves as their own control. Personalized genomic approach improved both sensitivity and specificity of early infection prediction.",

(i) thelarge genetic distance between the viral stock and the referencestrain [a/wisconsin/67/2005 (h3n2)], particularly in the pa,ha, and np gene segments, indicates that viral evolution oc-curred during generation of the viral stock.

(iii) the genetic distances betweenvirus isolated from a single subject at different time points aresometimes substantial, e.g., the distances between s12:d2, s12:d3, and s12:d6. this indicates that intrahost viral evolutionoccurs throughout the course of infection, either through de\nnovo mutation or due to temporal changes i",
